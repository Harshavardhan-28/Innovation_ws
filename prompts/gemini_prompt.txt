Act as an expert in agentic AI systems, product strategy, ethical automation, growth design, and startup validation.

I have an initial idea for a fully automated, agentic AI platform that helps students find internships without manually applying. 
Your task is to significantly deepen, refine, and validate this idea using structured analysis and tool-based reasoning.

==============================
CONTEXT / CORE IDEA
==============================
- Students provide their preferences, skills, sectors of interest, and constraints.
- An AI agent performs continuous web intelligence gathering to find internship opportunities that match the student.
- Another agent extracts publicly available HR / recruiter / TA contact details from company sites, LinkedIn alternatives, job boards, and career pages.
- Outreach agents automatically draft personalized cold emails and send them on behalf of the student.
- A voice agent (optional) performs AI-powered call outreach to HR when appropriate.
- A scheduling agent manages replies, follow-ups, interview scheduling, and reminders.

==============================
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
==============================

A. **Validate & Expand the Problem Space**  
- Identify the top 10 real-world student pain points that justify this solution.  
- Provide data-backed evidence or well-known trends.  
- Identify failures of existing platforms (LinkedIn, Internshala, Naukri, college TPO systems).  
- Identify high-friction tasks that agentic AI can automate better than humans.

B. **Define the Agentic System Design**  
For each required agent, specify:  
- Name of the agent  
- What it is responsible for  
- Inputs it needs  
- Outputs it generates  
- How it collaborates with other agents  
- Recommended tools/AI APIs to power it  
Include agents such as:  
1. Preference Intake Agent  
2. Opportunity Research & Company Intelligence Agent  
3. Web Scraping / Data Extraction Agent  
4. Contact Information Extraction Agent  
5. Email Outreach Agent  
6. Voice Call Outreach Agent  
7. Interview Scheduling Agent  
8. Progress Tracking / CRM Agent  
9. Safety, Compliance, and Consent Agent

C. **Compare & Recommend Tools**  
For each part of the system, compare at least **3 alternative tools/technologies**, using metrics:  
- accuracy  
- usability  
- speed of development  
- compliance & safety  
- cost  
- maintainability  
Recommend only the best tool and justify it clearly.

Examples to compare:  
- Scraping: Firecrawl vs Apify vs Browserless  
- Email automation: Resend vs Mailgun vs Gmail API  
- Voice AI: Vapi vs ElevenLabs vs Google Speech AI  
- AI Models: Gemini 2.0 vs OpenAI vs Claude  
- Databases: Firebase vs Supabase vs MongoDB  
- Hosting: Cloud Run vs Vercel vs Render  
- Chrome automation: Puppeteer vs Playwright vs Browserbase

D. **System Architecture**  
Produce:  
- a multi-agent workflow diagram (text-based)  
- a backend architecture (API + database + agents + automation)  
- data flow (student → preference engine → agents → outreach → response tracking)  
- a safety architecture for cold emailing, rate-limits, spam filters, and opt-out automation  

E. **Identify all Ethical, Legal, and Compliance Constraints**  
Cover:  
- scraping legality  
- GDPR  
- CAN-SPAM  
- student consent  
- opt-out management  
- contacting HR without spam violations  
- data retention limits  
- how to ethically automate phone calls  
Provide mitigation strategies for each.

F. **Design the Full User Journey**  
Include steps:  
1. Onboarding  
2. Preference definition  
3. AI agent mapping (skills, resume analysis, intent understanding)  
4. Continuous opportunity search  
5. AI outreach  
6. Response handling  
7. Interview scheduling  
8. Student dashboard  
Be very detailed — I need this for a case study.

G. **Roadmap & MVP Prioritization**  
- What should be built first (MVP scope)  
- What should be added in V2, V3  
- How to test the MVP with 20–50 real students  
- KPIs to measure success  

H. **Final Output**  
Provide:  
- A refined, pitch-ready concept statement  
- A 2–3 sentence product vision  
- A list of unique differentiators vs traditional job portals  
- Business model concepts suitable for students  

==============================

Make the response structured, deeply reasoned, tool-aware, and highly actionable. 
Avoid vague or generic statements — provide concrete mechanisms, examples, and comparisons.
