Search the web and compile a list of the most common, recurring, and high-impact problems faced by students (school, college, and university) that present strong opportunities for an entrepreneur to solve using a technology-based solution.

Focus on problems that:
- Affect a large number of students across regions
- Are persistent and well-documented
- Have clear pain points and measurable impact
- Have gaps in current solutions or underserved needs
- Could be solved using AI, software, apps, automation, or edtech tools

For each problem:
1. State the problem clearly in 2–3 lines.
2. Summarize the evidence that this is a major issue (data, surveys, expert insights).
3. Explain why existing solutions are insufficient.
4. Suggest potential tech-based solution directions (e.g., AI, ML, mobile app, SaaS, automation).
5. Provide citations for all claims.

Format the output as a structured list with headings:
- Problem
- Evidence
- Gap
- Tech Solution Direction

Ensure problems cover academics, mental health, productivity, financial stress, career guidance, information access, skill development, internships, exam prep, communication gaps, college management, and administrative challenges.
