Create a clean, modern, workshop-ready User Flow Architecture Diagram for an AI-powered product called InternScout AI — Autonomous Internship Matchmaker for Students.
Please design the diagram in a linear-but-layered workflow showing how a student interacts with the system end-to-end.

The diagram must visualize all high-level steps, system actions, agent actions, and backend interactions.
📌 Include These Stages in the User Flow
1. User Entry & Onboarding
Student signs up/login (Firebase Auth)
User enters preferences + uploads resume
2. System Intake
Resume parsing
Embedding generation
Preference extraction
Store data in DB + vector store
3. Multi-Agent Automation
Show each agent as a separate step:

Preference Intake Agent
Opportunity Discovery Agent
Contact Extraction Agent
Matching Engine
Email Outreach Agent
Voice Call Agent (optional)
Scheduler Agent
CRM & Tracking Agent
Safety & Compliance Agent
4. Data Sources
Internship portals
Company career pages
Public HR contact sources
Email API (Resend/Mailgun)
Voice API (Vapi/ElevenLabs)
5. Student Dashboard
View matched opportunities
See outreach progress
Track application responses
6. End State
Student receives internships
System continues scanning automatically
📌 Style Requirements for Nana Banana Pro
Use a clean user journey layout (left → right or top → bottom)
Make system/agent actions visually distinct from user actions
Use simple shapes: rounded rectangles for user actions, squares for system steps
Use arrows showing flow between steps
Group backend, agents, and external APIs in separate visual clusters
Keep spacing clean and presentation-friendly
📌 Output Expectations
Generate a full user-flow architecture diagram
No extra explanations, only the diagram
Should be immediately suitable for a slide deck or workshop
