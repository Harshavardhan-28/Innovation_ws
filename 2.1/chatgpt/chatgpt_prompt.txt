I am building an AI-powered product called InternScout AI — Autonomous Internship Matchmaker for Students.
I need a complete, end-to-end system architecture diagram using Mermaid.

Please generate a modern, clean, workshop-ready Mermaid flowchart TD architecture diagram that visually represents the entire application, not just the research phase.

📌 Include the Following Components in the Diagram
1. Frontend Layer

Student Web App (Next.js/Firebase Auth)

Resume upload + preference intake

Dashboard for opportunities + outreach status

2. Backend / Core System

API gateway / backend service layer

Database (Firebase/Supabase)

Vector store (profiles + job embeddings)

3. Multi-Agent System

Include all core agents:

Preference Intake Agent

Opportunity Discovery Agent (Scrapers + APIs)

Contact Extraction Agent (ethical/public data only)

Email Outreach Agent

Voice Call Agent (optional)

Scheduler Agent

CRM & Tracking Agent

Safety & Compliance Agent (GDPR + CAN-SPAM)

Show data flowing between agents and backend.

4. Data Sources

Internship portals (LinkedIn, Indeed, Naukri, etc.)

Company career pages

HR contact sources (public pages only)

Email API (Resend/Mailgun)

Voice API (Vapi/ElevenLabs)

5. Infrastructure

Cloud Run / Vercel / Firebase Functions

Cron-like scheduler

Storage bucket for resumes

Authentication provider

6. Processing Pipelines

Resume parsing

Embedding generation

Opportunity matching

Outreach automation

Response tracking pipeline

📌 Styling Requirements

Use Mermaid flowchart TD

Use classDef:

Tools/Agents → Blue

Data/DB → Yellow

External APIs → Gray

Frontend → Green

Infrastructure → Purple

Keep layout clean and easy for a workshop slide

DO NOT add commentary or explanation — return Mermaid code only
